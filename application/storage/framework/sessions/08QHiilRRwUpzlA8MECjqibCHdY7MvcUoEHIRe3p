   - **Outstanding Balance:** $15,582.39, which includes one due invoice and another that is overdue.
   - **Concerns:** The overdue invoice (amounting to $9,524.46) poses a risk for cash flow and necessitates immediate follow-up.

#### 4. **Risk Assessment**

   - **Client Expectations:** Zero fulfilled expectations with two pending (one of which is overdue). This may lead to dissatisfaction if not addressed promptly.

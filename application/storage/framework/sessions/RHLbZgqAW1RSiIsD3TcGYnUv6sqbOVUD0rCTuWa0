**Client Overview:**
- **Company Name:** Ernser PLC
- **Status:** Suspended
- **Joined:** June 16, 2025
- **Industry:** Not Available
- **Website:** [wyman.net](http://www.wyman.net/)
- **Total Invoices:** 4 (Last Invoice Date: June 15, 2025)

### Key Insights from Feedback Analysis
1. **Feedback Frequency and Recency:**
   - Total Feedback Entries: 20
   - Last Feedback Date: May 15, 2025 (56 days ago)
   - Feedback is received infrequently, with the last entry being over a month and a half ago. No recent feedback indicates a possible disengagement from the client.

2. **Average Feedback Score and Trend:**
   - Average Score: 4.2 
   - Feedback Trend: Stable
   - Despite the stable average, a lack of recent feedback may hint at underlying issues or disengagement.

3. **Common Themes:**
   - **Positive Themes:** Feedback ratings (CSAT of 5/5) indicate that when feedback is submitted, it leans positively.
   - **Negative Themes:** There are lower scores (e.g., 1/10 on NPS) indicating dissatisfaction or lack of loyalty.

4. **Specific Concerns/Praise:**
   - Low NPS scores suggest significant dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the service, which needs addressing.
   - Comments like "Explicabo eveniet odio magnam ullam sequi." lack clarity, necessitating a follow-up for detailed understanding.

### Financial Health Assessment
- **Total Invoiced:** $29,948.78
- **Total Paid:** $29,782.04
- **Outstanding Balance:** $166.74
- Payment history appears stable, yet the outstanding balance, although small, needs resolution before further engagement can be considered.

### Risk Assessment
1. **Expectations:**
   - Total Expectations: 2 (Both Pending)
   - Overdue Status: None; however, both readiness to be fulfilled needs monitoring with approaching deadlines.
  
2. **Project Status:**
   - One completed project and another not started; the client's suspended status and inactivity on projects could indicate a risk of losing future business.

3. **Communication Patterns:**
   - Support tickets have not been recently created and are unresolved since November 2024. This could signify either satisfaction or neglect by the client.

### Recommendations for Improving Client Satisfaction and Retention
1. **Re-establish Communication:**
   - Reach out to both contacts (Camylle Mertz and Rocio Boehm) to understand their current needs and perceptions about the past services.

2. **Address Outstanding Balance:**
   - Resolve the minor outstanding balance of $166.74 quickly to maintain financial rapport.

3. **Investigate Low NPS Scores:**
   - Conduct a follow-up survey specifically targeting the reasons behind the low NPS scores and seek how to improve client loyalty.

4. **Continuous Engagement:**
   - Foster more regular feedback loops and consider a dedicated help desk or account manager to address concerns proactively.

5. **Monitor Expectations Closely:**
   - Ensure that the two pending expectations are well communicated and followed up on before their due dates (July and November 2025).

### Opportunities for Upselling or Expanding Services
- With the engagement from the ongoing project, once resolved, explore more comprehensive packages that align with their industry (if identified) or modular services to meet broader needs.

### Red Flags or Immediate Attention Areas
- The client's suspended status is critical to address promptly. If unrelated to a minor financial issue, understand any root cause behind the suspension.
- A long gap in receiving feedback indicates possible client disengagement; this gap should be closed with a proactive outreach strategy to re-engage them.

### Conclusion
Ernser PLC presents a complex picture with notable strengths in their financial dealings but is currently disengaged. Immediate outreach, issue resolution, and strategic engagement could turn this situation around and enhance long-term client retention.";}}}
